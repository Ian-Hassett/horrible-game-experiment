# horrible-game-experiment
## should not be played
This is a unfinished game I was making in high school.
I decided to see how far I could go towards a platformer only reading documentation. no tutorieals.
I did this to learn how to make GUIs, take keyboard input,sound output, read and right to files and starting to use error handling.
This was a toe in the door for all of these consepts and each I can do better now.
This gives a good estimate of what my code looked like between junior and senior year of highchool.
If I where to go back to working on this I would refacter everything.

## stuff that works
The player is controlable
The physics work.
Item collection and item effects work.
The map editer autosaves.
The sound system works though I belive it is off in constants.
The sitching maps in a level system works.

## If you attempt to run
click on the blue stars
this was the very begining of a level select wich never happend.
If you reach a flag relaod the game as their is a bug were your speed increases on secend level select.

## controls
ASD to move
space to jump
W to fly up when able
click to change tile type at location of mouse 
right click to change item type at location of mouse
use 1 and 2 to toggle between the maps of the current level

## expected bugs
Their are tiles outlineing the ingame map.
there are many unfilled tiles in rotation so player charicter will glitch if in a tile that becomes a blank tile rather than air.
there is a glitch were the player gets stuck on the top left of the screen when walking on tiles.
expect many more.
