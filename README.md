# horrible-game-experiment
## should not be played
This is a unfinished game I was making in high school. I decided to see how far I could go towards a platformer without looking up how to do anything.
This gives a good estimate of what my code looked like at the time.
The physics work.
Item collection and item effects work.
There is even a saving map editor system.
